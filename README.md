# 🌸 Iris Flower Prediction using Neural Networks

## 📘 Overview
This project uses a **Neural Network** built with **TensorFlow and Keras** to classify iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*. The model learns from the classic **Iris dataset**, one of the most popular datasets in machine learning, to predict flower species based on sepal and petal dimensions.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing** – Load the Iris dataset, normalize input features, and one-hot encode target labels.
2. **Model Building** – Constructed a feedforward neural network with two hidden layers using ReLU activation and a softmax output layer.
3. **Model Compilation & Training** – Used *Adam* optimizer and *categorical cross-entropy* loss to train the model.
4. **Evaluation** – Achieved high accuracy on test data and visualized training performance using loss and accuracy curves.
5. **Model Saving & Loading** – Demonstrated saving the trained model for future predictions.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Understanding of feedforward neural networks.
- Implementation of dropout to prevent overfitting.
- Interpretation of softmax outputs and model predictions.
- Model evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics.

## 📂 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## 🚀 Results
The neural network achieved **over 90% accuracy** on the test set, successfully classifying iris species based on given features.
